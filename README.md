## Description:
        I have created three webpages that are connected to each other. They all have the same style with the navbars and footers.
        
        The first page is index.html. This page is my About Me page where I show a picture of myself along with a little bit of information about myself.

        The second page is portfolio.html. This page is where you will be able to find links to my future projects.

        The final page is contact.html. This page is where you can reach out and contact me about anything.

        I used bootstrap and css to create a responsive layout with responsive images. I used an external css file, style.css, as will  media queries.

## Installation:
    No installation needed

## Usage:
    I recommend inspecting the code so that can understand how I did what I did. There are many Projects what will be coming up soon so check the portfolio page regularly.

## Contributing:
    The following are the instructions that I was given:
    
        First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

        Create the following files files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

        Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

            A navbar

            A responsive layout

            Responsive images

        The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

        Screenshots are provided as a reference in the Assets/Images folder. Your app does not need to be exactly like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

    These instructions were given from the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp from the University and Trilogy.
